# Packages - Create Solution - Problem Statement

You've received a zipped project from a colleague.

After unzipping, you find it has a `main.py` file and a `requirements.txt` file. 

Your task is to:

1.  Set up a new virtual environment for this project.

2.  Install all the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

3.  Run `main.py` to confirm it works.
