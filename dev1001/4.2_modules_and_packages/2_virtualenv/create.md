# Virtual Env - Create Solution - Problem Statement

You are about to start a brand new web development project called 'WebAppBeta'. 

Your task is to:

1.  Create the project directory.

2.  Inside this directory, create a virtual environment. A common convention is to name it `.venv` (with a dot) so it's often hidden by default in listings and easily added to `.gitignore`.

3.  Activate this virtual environment.

4.  Confirm activation.
